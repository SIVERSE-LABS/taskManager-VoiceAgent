# Todo List

## Phase 1: Research and design the application architecture

- [x] Conduct deep research on existing task management applications, voice user interfaces, and neurodiversity-friendly design principles.
- [x] Design the overall application architecture, including backend, frontend, and voice integration.
- [x] Document the research findings and architectural design in a comprehensive report.

## Phase 2: Create the backend API with task management features

- [x] Set up the backend development environment.
- [x] Implement API endpoints for task creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.
- [x] Implement user authentication and authorization.
- [x] Develop logic for focus time tracking and task prioritization.

## Phase 3: Build the frontend interface with voice integration

- [x] Set up the frontend development environment.
- [x] Design and implement the user interface for task management.
- [x] Create responsive and neurodiversity-friendly design components.
- [x] Integrate basic voice interface components.
- [x] Test frontend functionality and ensure proper API integration.
- [ ] Integrate basic voice input capabilities.

## Phase 4: Integrate speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities

- [x] Integrate a robust speech-to-text engine for voice commands.
- [x] Implement text-to-speech functionality for user feedback.
- [x] Test voice command recognition accuracy and responsiveness.
- [x] Enhance voice interface with better error handling and user guidance.
- [ ] Integrate a text-to-speech engine for voice feedback.
- [ ] Develop natural language processing (NLP) for understanding user commands.

## Phase 5: Test the application locally and refine features

- [x] Conduct unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
- [x] Perform user acceptance testing with neurodivergent individuals (simulated).
- [x] Refine features based on testing feedback.

## Phase 6: Deploy the application and deliver to user

- [x] Prepare the application for deployment.
- [x] Deploy the backend API.
- [x] Deploy the frontend application.
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation package.
- [x] Package complete codebase with setup instructions.
- [x] Deliver final application to user.
- [ ] Deploy the frontend application.
- [x] Provide instructions and documentation to the user.
